- ‚úÖ Create React App: [examples/create-react-app](./examples/create-react-app/) (unit tests execution is not working, we are investigating the issue üîç)

## Vanilla-extract

Filament React internally uses [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) for the styling.
That's why your React app needs [vanilla-extract plugin](https://vanilla-extract.style/documentation/getting-started#bundler-integration) to compile (build-time) the theme styling to css files.
You can also use vanilla-extract for your app styling or you can use whatever you think best suits for your case.

## NPM registry

Filament React packages can be installed with npm / yarn from Artifactory.

For that reason you need in your .npmrc / .yarnrc / .yarnrc.yml file registry set to:

https://artifactory-ehv.ta.philips.com/artifactory/api/npm/dl-common-npm

or proxy link:

https://registry-reflector.eu1.phsdp.com

```
//.npmrc
registry=https://artifactory-ehv.ta.philips.com/artifactory/api/npm/dl-common-npm
```

```
//.yarnrc (Yarn 1)
registry "https://artifactory-ehv.ta.philips.com/artifactory/api/npm/dl-common-npm"
```

```
//.yarnrc.yml (Yarn 2+)
npmRegistryServer: "https://artifactory-ehv.ta.philips.com/artifactory/api/npm/dl-common-npm"
```
